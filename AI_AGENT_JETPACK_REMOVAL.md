## ✅ **Successfully Completed**

The `ai-agent-jetpack` folder has been **removed from Git tracking** while keeping the folder and files available locally.

### 🔧 **What Was Done**

   ```

   - Removed `ai-agent-jetpack/line_webhook.py` from Git
   - Files remain on your local filesystem

2. **Updated .gitignore**:

   # AI Agent tools (removed from Git tracking, keep local only)
   ai-agent-jetpack/
   ```

### 📊 **Current Status**

🔒 Git Status:      ✅ IGNORED (will not be tracked or committed)

```

### 🎯 **Benefits**

### 🚀 **Next Steps**

You can now commit the changes to finalize the removal:

```bash
# Commit the removal and .gitignore update
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Remove ai-agent-jetpack from Git tracking

- Untracked ai-agent-jetpack folder from repository
- Updated .gitignore to prevent future tracking
- Files kept locally for development use"
```

### ✅ **Verification Commands**
